# Pacmann-Data-Wrangling-and-SQL

Olist is an ecommerce platform that integrate sellers and marketplaces. 
Olist provided sellers with tools to manage products, make sales, customer service, and receive payments in a single place.

In this project, I try to analize Olist dataset, to know:

1. Relation between order and customers growth
2. Customer satisfaction, the cause and the effect 
3. Top ten most ordered product category
4. Customerâ€™s state ranked in term of number and total value order
5. Trend of payment type for order

Before analizing, I did data checking such as NaN identification, Data inconsistency (Field value, Table record relation) and Other checking. 
I used sql syntax in <b>data checking.sql</b> file to  do it, and update the dataset if needed <b>(data updating.sql)</b>. 
Summary of the updates made, can be seen in the table below.

After data checking, I create view to generate data for analizing to achieve the objectives 
and create index to accelerate query in sqlite database <b>(view creation.sql and index creation.sql)</b>. 
To visualize, I create python code to access olist dataset and create graph refer to the data <b>(datawranglingsqlproject.py)</b>
